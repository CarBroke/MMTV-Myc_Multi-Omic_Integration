Properly format your GCT files: https://www.genepattern.org/file-formats-guide#GCT

Data should be normalized beforehand.

Make sure the description column (second column) is either absent or contains strings and not integers or floats.

There should also be no spaces in your file as that will throw off the algorithm.

You may get an error called "Error in solve.default(t(design) %*% design) : system is computationally singular". This means some of the values are so close to zero (e.g. 2.0e-18) or that the matrix is not invertible (i.e. your columns are linearly dependent). Try removing features (i.e. genes) that are extremely highly correlated.

Ultimately I was not able to use the cloud version of ComBat hosted on GenePattern and needed to implement the R package locally.
